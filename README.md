## Project review

The objective of this project is to create tweet cards with interactive
featuresfor the user. When the "Follow" button is clicked, it's text changes to
"Following" along with a change in button color. Additionally, the number of
followers increases by adding the user's count to the current value.

To store user data, a personal backend is implemented using the mockapi.io
service. The database contains a total of 50 users with different values, which
are displayed in the tweet cards. There is an option to load additional tweets
by clicking the "Load More" button, providing pagination functionality.

Furthermore, the project includes routing functionality. The application has two
main routes: the home page ("/") and the tweets page ("/tweets"). Additionally,
tweet card filtering has been implemented.
